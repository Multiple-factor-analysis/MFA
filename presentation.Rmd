# Multiple Factor Analysis  
  What is MFA? 
  
# MFA package introduction

# Shiny App
We develop a shiny app that provides an interactive visualizeation for the results from MFA. We provide
the user with four types of plots, and the user can select which plot to look at.

  - *a bar-chart of the eigenvalues* 
  - *a scatterplot of the common factor scores* 
  - *a scatter plot of the partial factor scores* 
  - *a scatter plot of the partial factor scores and the loadings* 

For scatter plot (3) and (4), the user can choose which two dimensions to plot by adjusting the slider bar, and the
plots will update automatically.
