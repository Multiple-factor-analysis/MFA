# Main function: mfa-part 1
We provide a main function mfa() in our package:
    
  _mfa(data, sets, ncomps=NULL, center=TRUE, scale=TRUE)_ where the arguments are:
  
- data: data set (matrix or data frame)
- sets: list of character or numeric vectors indicating the sets of variables 
- ncomps: integer indicating how many factors are to be extracted
- center: either a logical value or a numeric vector determining how column centering is perfromed
- scale: either a logical value or a numeric vector determining how the scaling of active variables is performed (after centering)

# Main function: mfa-part 2
mfa function should return on object of class *"mfa"* with the following elements:

- eigen: vector containing the eigenvalues 
- common_factor_scores: matrix of common factor scores
- partial_factor_scores: matrix of partial factor scores
- loadings: matrix of loadings
    
we also provide other information such as alpha, mass=rep(1/nrow,nrow), dim=ncomps and the complete scaled matrix for the user.
   
# MFA package introduction

# Shiny App
We develop a shiny app that provides an interactive visualizeation for the results from MFA. We provide
the user with six types of plots, and the user can select which plot to look at.

  - *a bar-chart of the eigenvalues* 
  - *a scatterplot of the common factor scores* 
  - *a scatter plot of the partial factor scores* 
  - *a scatter plot of the partial factor scores and the loadings* 
  - *a bar-chart of bootstrap ratios*
  - *a bootstrap confidence ellipses plot*

For the two scatter plots related to partial factor scores and loadings, the user can choose which two dimensions to plot by adjusting the slider bar, and the plots will update automatically.
